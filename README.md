USAGE: bingo [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
  -k    update wallpaper once and exit

`bingo` is best run as a daemon, so that it can update your wallpaper in the background every day.

You should preferably register it with your OS as a startup application. If you're using GNOME you can do so in _Startup Applications_:

If you only want to update your wallpaper "on demand" then run it with the `-k` flag:

`$ bingo -k`
